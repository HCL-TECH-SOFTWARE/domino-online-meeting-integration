## DOMI Oauth Application

The web application uses [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io). This was a technology choice because Vert.x removes the need for deployment to a web server, provides pre-built Java libraries for OAuth integration and there was in-house expertise to allow rapid development.

### Project Documentation

You can access the project documentation generated by Maven (including a JavaDoc) by opening the <a href="{{'/assets/webapp-reports/project-info.html' | relative_url}}" target="_new">Product Documentation</a>

### Endpoints Available

For each provider, this application provides endpoints for retrieving a token, callback for short-term code (only for use from OAuth providers), refreshing a token and (where supported by the online meeting provider) revoking a token. The endpoints in use are:

- If a Zoom Client ID and secret are passed into the application   
  - /dominoZoom/index.html
  - /zoomCallback
  - /dominoZoomRefresh
  - /dominoZoomRevoke
- If a Teams Client ID and secret are passed into the application  
  - /dominoTeams/index.html
  - /teamsCallback
  - /dominoTeamsRefresh
- If a GoToMeeting Client ID and secret are passed into the application

- If a Webex Client ID and secret are passed into the application  
  - /dominoWebex/index.html
