## Team Mailboxes

Online meetings are created against a personal account for the meeting service. As a result, the Online Meeting Credentials documents are restricted to access by the author and the owner of the mail database. For team mailboxes, if you wish to create online meetings, each person should set up their own Online Meeting Credentials. If a shared identity has been set up, your Domino Developer will need to make changes to enable all people to share the Online Meeting Credentials.
