## Documentation for HCL Notes Users

To use Domino Online Meeting Integration, your Domino Administrator will first need to have deployed it to your mail database. If that has happened, in the *Views* outline category you will see an entry for the *Online Meeting Credentials* view.

The functionality is designed for adding ad hoc meetings to your calendar entries. If you have fixed rooms you want to add to a calendar entry, you can use the pre-existing functionality.

The offering is not yet available in HCL Verse.

There are two steps:
- Creating an online meeting credentials profile.  
- Creating an ad hoc online meeting for a calendar entry.
