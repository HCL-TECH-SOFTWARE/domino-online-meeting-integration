## Online Meeting Credentials

You need to set up an Online Meeting Credentials profile for each meeting provider you wish to create ad hoc meetings for. The options available will depend on what has been set up. The process only differs slightly for Sametime, which will only be available if your Domino Administrator has specified a Sametime Meetings server.
