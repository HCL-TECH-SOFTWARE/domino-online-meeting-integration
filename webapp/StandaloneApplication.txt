Running DOMI as standalone application ("FAT" jar )

The pom.xml uses the Maven shade plugin to assemble the application and all it's dependencies into a single "fat" jar.

To build a "fat jar"

    mvn package

To run the fat jar:

    java -jar target/java -jar com.hcl.labs.domi-1.0.3-fat.jar
    
You can also run the fat jar with maven:

    mvn package exec:exec@run-app    
    
Now point your browser at http://localhost:8878    

You can take that jar and run it anywhere there is a Java 8+ JDK. It contains all the dependencies it needs so you
don't need to install Vert.x on the target machine.

create domiconfig.d in the same location where you have copied the ...fat.jar to
change into domiconfig.d and create a config.json file

On Linux, export OAUTH_HOSTNAME and any other environment variables ( for ZOOM, it looks like this )

export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID=1234567890
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET=1234567890
export OAUTH_HOSTNAME=http://localhost

You can now start DOMI as a standalone application

java -jar <YourJarLocation>/java -jar com.hcl.labs.domi-1.0.3-fat.jar

By now, this has only be tested on CentOS Linux, but it should work on Windows as well
